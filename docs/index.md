# Atomic Router

Simple routing implementation that provides abstraction layer instead of inline URL's and does not break your architecture

- Type-safe
- No inline URL's
- Atomic routes
- Does not break architecture

## Why atomic routes?

There are 3 purposes for using atomic routes:

- To abstract the application from hard-coded paths
- To provide you a declarative API for a comfortable work
- To avoid extra responsibility in app features
